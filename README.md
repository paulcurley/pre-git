## Why?

You can easily run the `pre-commit` and `pre-push` Git hooks to
[avoid breaking the local master branch](http://glebbahmutov.com/blog/never-break-master-by-accident/)
or the [remote master](http://glebbahmutov.com/blog/never-break-remote-master-again/).

### Installation

It's advised to install this module as `devDependency` in your `package.json`
file so it doesn't get installed on production servers. Run:

```
npm install pre-git --save-dev
```

### Configuration

Specify commands to run on *commit* and on *push* in your package.json under `config > pre-git`
object.

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "node-qunit *.js"
},
"config": {
  "pre-git": {
    "commit-msg": "simple",
    "pre-commit": [
      "grunt jshint"
    ],
    "post-commit": "git status",
    "pre-push": [
      "rm -rf node_modules",
      "npm install",
      "grunt build",
      "grunt test"
    ],
    "post-merge": "npm install"
  }
}
```

If there are older settings like `pre-commit`, etc, you will have to move
them to the `config > pre-git` object manually.

Related project: [post-merge-make](https://github.com/bahmutov/post-merge-make)
runs `make post-merge` after pull or merge.

## Details

You can always skip pre-commit hook (but not pre-push hook!) by using `-n` option

    git commit -m "done, don't check me" -n

You can skip the pre-push hook using `--no-verify` option

To run just the hook (for example to test what it does), execute

```bash
.git/hooks/pre-commit
.git/hooks/pre-push
```

Since there might be no changes to push, you can force the `pre-commit` hook to execute
using `-f` or `--force` argument

```bash
.git/hooks/pre-commit -f
```

## Validating commit message

By default, this package will install both the message validator
and the message format helper. You can disable the validation
by removing the below command.

```json
"config": {
  "pre-git": {
    "commit-msg": "conventional"
  }
}
```

When you run `git commit -m "message ..."` the hook will enforce the default style
`type(scope): message ...`. To better form the message, there is a CLI wizard
installed based on [commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen) project,
very well shown in the tutorial
[video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-how-to-write-a-javascript-library-writing-conventional-commits-with-commitizen). The commit wizard is available under "node_modules/.bin/commit-wizard" link
and can be started from command line

    node --harmony node_modules/.bin/commit-wizard

or via a script

```json
"scripts": {
  "commit": "commit-wizard"
}
```

Then run

    npm run commit

The wizard will look something like this

```
? Select the type of change that you're committing:
  feat:     A new feature
‚ùØ fix:      A bug fix
  chore:    Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
            and libraries such as documentation generation
```

There are 2 plugins included with `pre-git`:

* "conventional" follows AngularJS log convention,
  see [simple-commit-message](https://github.com/bahmutov/simple-commit-message)
* "simple" only allows "feat", "fix" and "chore" commit types,
  see [conventional-commit-message](https://github.com/bahmutov/conventional-commit-message)

I recommend sticking with "simple" unless you need more release types.

## Development

In order to locally test this package, from another git repo execute the install script
using `-f` or `--force` argument. For example

```
$ node ../pre-git/install.js -f
pre-git 0.7.2 in /Users/kensho/git/test-git-hooks
/Users/kensho/git/test-git-hooks
read target package from /Users/kensho/git/test-git-hooks/package.json
added empty command list for hook commit-msg
added empty command list for hook pre-commit
added empty command list for hook pre-push
added empty command list for hook post-commit
added empty command list for hook post-merge
saving updated files /Users/kensho/git/test-git-hooks/package.json
```

I am using a small project [test-pre-git](https://github.com/bahmutov/test-pre-git)
as a test playground for these hooks.
